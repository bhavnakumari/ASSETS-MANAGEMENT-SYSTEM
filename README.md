# DTG-ASSETS-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
This is the CODE FRONT and CODE BEHIND which I have made using Microsoft Visual Studio. It is a website that will keep a count of the assets(Monitor, CPU, Servers, Keyboards, etc) given to all the employees in a company that is linked with Oracle database Reader.it consists of three panels :


1.THE MASTER PANEL- Through this page, you can insert the assets through serial number in your database.
2. THE ASSIGN PANEL-Through this page, you can assign the assets to the staff of your company for that the staff's name has to be in the database of the company.  
3. THE RETREIVE PANEL-Through this page, you can retrieve the assets given to the employees.
